# ABT UI

### Instructions for new users:

You will need to run some commands in order to get the CAN controller up and running, follow the instructions on this link: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2-CH_CAN_HAT.

After successfully initializing the CAN interfaces, in order to run the UI you need to perform a couple of more steps:
1. cd into scripts folder and run setup_UI.sh to install all the required packages.
2. If you desire for the UI to run everytime a new terminal is opened add the line "ABT_UI" into your .bashrc file.
